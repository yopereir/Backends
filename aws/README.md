# AWS
This repo tracks several artifacts that can be used to interact with AWS.

## Conventions
* `scripts` folder contains general scripts to interact with AWS.
* `configs` folder contains configurations for different AWS Services.
* Each folder has a sub-folder denoting the specific AWS Service that it will be used for. ex: `scripts/EC2/` will have EC2 related scripts.
* `General` sub-folder will exist where artifacts that deal with 2+ Services or are Service agnostic are stored. ex: `configs/General/conventions.md`.
